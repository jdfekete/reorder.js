To help develop Reordering.js, you need to have [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org)
and [NPM](http://www.npmjs.org) installed. Once you have done that, run the
following from the root directory of this repository to install the development
dependencies:

    make install

## Thanks

Thanks to [Renaud Blanch](http://iihm.imag.fr/blanch/) for giving me his implementation of the 'Optimal Leaf Ordering' algorithm. He has improved it and the distribution is available as [ordering](https://bitbucket.org/rndblnch/ordering).

I originally started this in order to add a reordering module to
[D3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/).

The project structure and Makefile is based on that of D3, so a big thank you
goes to [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) for this.
